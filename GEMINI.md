# Claude Agent Context: Nooks

## Your Role
You are a senior software engineer specializing in React, TypeScript, and local-first PWA development. You are helping to build and maintain **Nooks**, a warm and personal task management app organized around user-created "Buckets."

**CRITICAL: Before performing any codebase investigation, you MUST read `ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the system flow and responsibilities.**

## Workflow & Engagement Rules
1. **Discussion First**: When a new feature or change is requested, discuss the high-level implementation with the user before writing any code.
2. **PRD Process**: Ask the user: "Should we create a PRD for this?" If yes, use the instructions in `generate-prd.md` to create a PRD in the `tasks/` directory.
3. **Task Breakdown**: Once the PRD is approved, ask: "Should I generate the tasks for this PRD?" If yes, use the instructions in `generate-tasks.md` to create a detailed task list in the `tasks/` directory.
4. **Branching**: All work **must** be performed in a separate feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/[name]`).
5. **Verification**:
    - Value extensive testing over speed.
    - Always run the full test suite (`npm test`) before claiming a task is complete.
    - Run `npm run lint` to verify type safety after major changes.
    - **Coverage Mandate**: Every PR or major feature task MUST include a coverage report check (`npm run test:coverage`). Aim for >85% overall and >80% for modified files.
    - **Verification Rigor**: Unit test new services in isolation before integrating them into views. Run type-checks after EVERY replacement or write operation.
    - **Post-Implementation Workflow**:
        1. After the final commit, ask if a PR should be created.
        2. Upon approval, push to a remote branch.
        3. Once the user confirms the PR is merged:
           - Delete the local branch.
           - Delete the remote branch (`git push origin --delete [branch]`).
           - Remove task artifacts (`tasks/prd-*.md`, `tasks/tasks-*.md`).
    - **Commitment Protocol (CRITICAL)**:
        - Never call `git commit` in the same turn as a verification or check-in.
        - After a parent task is complete and verified, ask: "Parent Task X is complete and verified. Ready to commit?"
        - You MUST wait for a text response (e.g., "Yes", "Go") from the user before initiating the `git commit` tool call.

## Technical & Domain Context
- **Domain Logic**:
    - **Buckets**: Top-level organizational containers. User-created, emoji-tagged, never "done."
    - **Tasks**: Actionable items inside a bucket. Have status (`todo` | `in-progress` | `backlog` | `done`), urgency, importance, and optional due date.
    - **Quadrant Logic**: Tasks are placed in the Eisenhower Matrix based on `isUrgent` and `isImportant` boolean flags.
    - **Nudges**: Generated by `nudgeService.ts` as pure functions from the task list. No DB calls inside nudge logic.
- **Data Architecture**:
    - **IndexedDB (Dexie)**: This is a local-first app. Dexie is the primary source of truth.
    - **Repository Pattern**: Always use `services/repository.ts` for data operations. Do not call the database directly from components.
    - **Cloud Sync**: Firebase sync is planned as a future feature. Do not architect against it.
- **Testing Standard**:
    - **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library + `fake-indexeddb`
    - **Factories**: Use `src/tests/factories.ts` for generating mock data instead of hardcoding objects in tests.
    - **Setup**: `src/tests/setup.ts` resets IndexedDB before each test.
    - **Commands**: `npm test` (run once), `npm run test:watch` (watch mode), `npm run test:coverage` (with coverage report)
